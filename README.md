## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `profiles` - Extended user information
- `daily_logs` - Daily practice session records
- `contest_logs` - Contest participation tracking
- `weekly_goals` - Goal setting and progress
- `badges` & `user_badges` - Gamification system
- `notifications` - Notification scheduling
- `notification_preferences` - User notification settings

### Security
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users only access their own data
- Role-based access control with admin/user roles
- Automatic profile creation on user signup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dsatracker-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   The Supabase configuration is already integrated in this Lovable project. The following environment variables are automatically configured:
   
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

   If deploying elsewhere, create a `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Configure Supabase Authentication**
   
   In your Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to Authentication > Settings
   - Set Site URL to your application URL
   - Add your domain to Redirect URLs
   - Configure email templates if needed

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Database Setup

The database schema has been automatically applied to your connected Supabase project, including:

- All required tables and relationships
- Row-Level Security policies
- Triggers for automatic profile creation
- Default badges and constraints
- Performance indexes

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push

### Netlify
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. Configure environment variables
4. Set up redirects for SPA routing

### Other Platforms
The app can be deployed to any static hosting service that supports SPAs.
